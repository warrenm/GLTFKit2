#  GLTFKit2

GLTFKit2 is an efficient glTF loader and exporter for Objective-C and Swift.

This project is a spiritual successor of the [GLTFKit](https://github.com/warrenm/GLTFKit) project, with many of the same aims, but some notable differences. GLTFKit2:

 - includes import and export (WIP), while GLTFKit was read-only.
 - strives to be as interoperable as possible, with extensions for Model I/O, SceneKit, and QuickLook. 
 - tries to retain all of the information from the asset file, meaning extensions and extras are available to client code even if they are unrecognized by the loader.
 - uses cgltf and JSMN internally to load the JSON portion of glTF files, which is more efficient than parsing with `NSJSONSerialization`.

## Usage

### Using the Framework

The GLTFKit2 Xcode project is completely self-contained and can be used to build a Cocoa framework for macOS. If you want to use GLTFKit2 as a framework, link to it and embed it in your target. You can also opt to include the source directly in your app target.

### Loading Assets

To load a glTF 2.0 model, import `<GLTFKit2/GLTFKit2.h>` and use the `GLTFAsset` class. Since assets can take a while to load, prefer to use the async loading methods.

**Objective-C**:

```obj-c
[GLTFAsset loadAssetWithURL:url
                    options:@{}
                    handler:^(float progress, 
                              GLTFAssetStatus status, 
                              GLTFAsset *asset, 
                              NSError *error, 
                              BOOL *stop)
{
    // Check for completion and/or error, use asset if complete, etc.
}
```

**Swift**:

```swift
GLTFAsset.load(with: url, options: [:]) { (progress, status, maybeAsset, maybeError, _) in
    // Check for completion and/or error, use asset if complete, etc.
}
```

The URL must be a local file URL. Loading of remote assets and resources is not supported.

### Interoperating with SceneKit

The framework can be used to easily transform glTF assets into `SCNScene`s to interoperate with SceneKit.

First, load the asset as shown above. Then, to get the default scene of a glTF asset, use the `SCNScene` class extension method `+[SCNScene sceneWithGLTFAsset:]`.

### Using Draco Mesh Decompression

GLTFKit2 supports meshes compressed with the [Draco geometry compression library](https://github.com/google/draco) through a plugin system. To activate Draco decompression support, implement the `GLTFDracoMeshDecompressor` protocol in your target, then set the `dracoDecompressorClassName` property on `GLTFAsset` to the name of the conforming class. The framework will then use the supplied class to convert compressed mesh data into glTF primitives which are suitable for rendering. A sample Draco decompressor class is provided in the macOS GLTFViewer target. You are responsible for compiling and linking to the Draco library itself in your own target. If you would prefer not to compile the library yourself, consider using [DracoSwift](https://github.com/warrenm/DracoSwift).

### Using KTX2 with Basis Universal

GLTFKit2 optionally supports the [KHR_texture_basisu](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu) extension for loading KTX2 with Basis Universal textures via [libktx](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software). This repository contains a pre-built XCFramework with Universal binaries for macOS and iOS. If you wish to use KTX2 textures in your target, simply add `GLTFKit2/deps/libktx/ktx.xcframework` to the GLTFKit2 **framework** target, and it will automatically be detected and used to load KTX2 textures, whether embedded or stored externally in ktx2 files.

 Extension support indicates that an extension's features are available as first-class objects through the `GLTFAsset` API. Not all features are available after an asset is bridged to another framework (e.g. SceneKit) that does not have support for such features. In particular, no Apple-provided rendering engine supports transmission or volume rendering at this time.

### Conformance

This implementation is known to be **non-conforming** to the glTF 2.0 specification and is under active development.
